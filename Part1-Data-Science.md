# Data Science
In this new world full of data, it becomes difficult to manage and analyse the data at a greater scale. Here comes the new skill **Data Science** handy.

Data Science is a field of analysing and picking insightful information from raw data.
A **Data Scientist** is one who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to create insights and analysis on relatively larger data or big data.
### Skills required for a Data Scientist are:
- Mathematics
- Statistics
- Data Processing
- Data Analysis
- Computer Science/Programming
- Machine Learning

In the image below you can see a Venn Diagram showing how fields are interlinked.

### Applications of Data Science in different Fields
1. **Medical and Healthcare**
  - Data Science is used to obtain accurate diagnostic measures based on patients' medical history.
  - Tracking and predicting a disease has been heard by most of us and is possible due to data science where the patients' health is continuously analysed collaborating with IoTs (Internet of Things).
  - It can be even used to enhance the medical imaging to get better perspective.
2. **Banking and Finance**
  - Data Science has played a vital role in banking industry after the 2008 financial crisis.
  - Banks use data science in the areas of customer service, fraud detection, target marketing, etc.
  - In stock market, a time series model is used for predicting the stock price and calculating risk.
3. **Recommendation Systems**
  - Recommendations are used in most fields like advertising, shopping. entertainment.
  - Data Science can be used to analyse the behaviour of the customer and create ML models to recommend the advertisements or products the customer may be looking for.
4. **Gaming**
  - You may have heard this word "Gaming Experience Enhanced", but actually how the experience is enhanced? Yes Data Science!!
  - Prevents gameplay issues like slow loading speed and frame dropping in real-time gaming.
  - It is used in game development like based on the engagement and interest in a game can be used to develop a similar but more efficient and creative game.
5. **Manufacturing**
  - Data Science is used to defective tracking and quality assurance on the production line.
  - It is very helpful in Supply Chain Optimization to tackle with market risks and pricing to increase in profits.
  - Predicting a competitive price for the product based on market and customer inputs.
