# NumPy
NumPy **(Numerical Python)** is an open source Python library that’s used  for working with numerical data in Python.
It is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

Numpy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.

## Pre-Requisites
* Basic working knowledge of Python.

## Installing NumPy
### Attention!!! You must already have Python:snake: installed in order to install Numpy.
If you already have Python, you can install NumPy with:
```python
   pip install numpy
```
**Or**
```python
   conda install numpy
  ```
 If you don’t have Python yet, you might want to consider using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). It’s the easiest way to get started.


## How to Import Numpy
Any time you want to use a package or library in your code, you first need to make it accessible.
In order to start using NumPy and all of the functions available in NumPy, you’ll need to import it. This can be easily done with this import statement:
```python
   import numpy as np
 ```
> (You can use any variable instead of **np**) 

## Those who have problems installing Pyhton on PCs or have problem Installing Jupyter Notebooks and using them.Instead of that you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) its a jupyter notebook on cloud which anyone can use and its free.Its fast and you can do all the coding you want in there.:smile::smiley:
